# Student Score Predictor ðŸ“ˆ

This project uses simple Linear Regression to predict student scores based on the number of hours studied.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
A small custom dataset with two columns:
- Hours: Number of hours a student studied
- Scores: Marks obtained by the student

## ðŸ“ˆ Output
- Displays a scatter plot of hours vs scores
- Trains a linear regression model
- Prints predicted vs actual values
- Shows the regression line and calculates Mean Squared Error

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`
2. Run the script: `python student_score_predictor.py`

## âœ¨ Example
```
Hours Studied: 5.0, Actual Score: 60, Predicted Score: 61.23
```
